               Tell me why, I love you like I do. Tell me who, could stop my heart as much as you. Let’s take each other’s hand, as we jump into the final frontier. Mad about you baby, yeah, I’m mad about you. Whoo hoo hoo.

               It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on tv, but where are those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there’s a family guy, lucky there’s a man who positively can do all the things that make us laugh and cry – he’s our family guy!

               In an age when nature and magic rule the world, there is an extraordinary legend: the story of a warrior who communicates with animals, who fights sorcery and the unnatural. His name is Dar, last of his tribe. He is also called Beastmaster.

               You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension: a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You’re moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas; you’ve just crossed over into the Twilight Zone.

               The year is 1987 and NASA launches the last of America’s deep space probes. In a freak mishap, Ranger 3 and its pilot Captain William ‘Buck’ Rogers are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support system and returns Buck Rogers to Earth five hundred years later.
