It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on tv, but where are those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there’s a family guy, lucky there’s a man who positively can do all the things that make us laugh and cry – he’s our family guy!

               Our whole universe was in a hot dense state, then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait… The Earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool. Neanderthals developed tools, we built a wall (we built the pyramids). Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries, that all started with the big bang!

There were six people who loved to watch television, but they didn’t like what they saw. Armed with determination and a strong will to change the course of television, they wrote their own shows, but that wasn’t enough, they had to sell them. They went straight to the networks, but the networks were not ready for them. But did that stop them? No. They built their own network and they liked what they saw.

What ever happened to predictability? The milkman, the paperboy, evening TV. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there’s a heart, a hand to hold onto. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go. There’s a face of somebody who needs you.
Everywhere you look, when you’re lost out there and you’re all alone, a light is waiting to carry you home, Everywhere you look. Everywhere you look.

               Since the dawn of time, there has been a process to developing web you start with a design, get it approved by whoever’s sitting on the money, then you build from that. It’s more than just tradition, it’s the way it’s done. To question the process publicly would brand you a renegade, a free thinker… a troublemaker. That can cost you gigs. So, you do it the way it’s always been done. Conform and survive. Cash them checks.

In these presentations, you often require ‘dummy text’ to fill out the places where actual text will go once the money men buy it from some other overpriced consultant. Historically, this dummy text is a block of fake latin boilerplate that begins with ‘Lorem Ipsum’. It fills up the space with sentences and paragraphs, but it’s been used so long by so many that – like banner ads and tv commercials – people just gloss over it without paying any attention to the contents. Herein lies your opportunity to subvert the timeless standard.

Sure, you can use this space to tout the benefits to be had by smashing the state and/or killing everyone over the age of 30, but a far safer bet is to fill out that area with something unoffensive yet different, something that will get you remembered favorably by the mouthbreathers that pay you to slap their crap up on the web, reinforcing your revenue stream while you synergize your brand across shifting paradigms and all that other corporate jibberish. The answer comes in this, a random text generator for those of us who are above dead languages and unquestioned tradition.

               You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life, the facts of life. There’s a time you got to go and show you’re growin’ now you know about the facts of life, the facts of life. When the world never seems to be livin up to your dreams and suddenly you’re finding out the facts of life are all about you.

There once was a story about a man who could turn invisible. I thought it was only a story… until it happened to me. Ok, so here’s how it works: there’s this stuff called Quicksilver that can bend light. Some scientist made it into a synthetic gland, and that’s where I came in. See, I was facing life in prison and they were looking for a human experiment. So, we made a deal. They put the gland in my brain; I walk free. The operation was a success… but that’s where everything started to go wrong.

Making your way in the world today takes everything you’ve got. Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. Wouldn’t you like to get away? Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they’re always glad you came. You wanna be where you can see, our troubles are all the same. You wanna be where everybody knows your name. You wanna go where people know, people are all the same, you wanna go where everybody knows your name.

It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on tv, but where are those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there’s a family guy, lucky there’s a man who positively can do all the things that make us laugh and cry – he’s our family guy!

               Now, the world don’t move to the beat of just one drum, what might be right for you, may not be right for some. A man is born, he’s a man of means. Then along come two, they got nothing but their jeans. But they got, Diff’rent Strokes, it takes Diff’rent Strokes. It takes Diff’rent Strokes to move the world.

People let me tell you ’bout my best friend, he’s a warm-hearted person who’ll love me till the end. People let me tell you ’bout my best friend, he’s a one boy cuddly toy, my up, my down, my pride and joy. People let me tell you ’bout him he’s so much fun whether we’re talkin’ man to man or whether we’re talking son to son. Cause he’s my best friend. Yes he’s my best friend.

This is Herman Brooks. Herman is just like the rest of us. Everyday he has to make all kinds of decisions like what to wear, whom to date and when to panic. Now these decisions should be easy but if you take a look inside Herman’s head, you’ll see why he sometimes has trouble making up his mind. Sometimes they agree… usually they don’t. But the struggle is going on inside all of us and it’s all going on inside Herman’s head.
